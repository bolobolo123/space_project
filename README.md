SpaceViz is a project done for an intensive week during the second term of the second year @ Hetic.
The main objective was to use API to make a space-themed website using HTML5/CSS3/JS/PHP. 

Our main focus was to create something inovative, and appealing for users. Centered around the user, the experience allows the user to dive in the immensity of space through numbers.
Using 5 API's to get trivia from various databases, the application updates itself by using new data everyday from providers like NASA.
This project was imagined, designed and developped in only 4 days.

## Features :

    - Gives basic astrology informations about the user
    - Gives comparisons with universes creation and such
    - Gives information about launches that occured during user's life
    - Gives up to date informations, that may evolve everyday
